Building the CVS Version of COPOS
====================================

Qrust's Berlios CVS repository can be checked out through
anonymous (pserver) CVS with the following instruction set.
When prompted for a password for anonymous, simply press the Enter key. 

  $ cvs \
      -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/copos \
      login
  $ cvs -z3 \
      -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/copos \
      co qrust

When you are at work on the CVS version of Qrust, you can use bootstrap.sh
for generating configure script and Makefiles.

  $ ./bootstrap.sh
  $ make
  $ make install

You may have to set ACLOCAL_FLAGS environment variable for some m4
macros used in configure.in.

The following versions of the GNU autotools are required.

  autoconf 2.x and above
  automake 1.4.x
  libtool  1.4
